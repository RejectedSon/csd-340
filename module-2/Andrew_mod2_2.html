    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <div class="intro">
	<p>My name is Benjamin Andrew, and I am currently enrolled at Bellevue University as a Junior. Most of my time is spent working at Chilli's as a dishwasher
    	or here at school. I am currently a 4.0 student and have been on the Dean's list every semester since my start here at Bellevue. As a member of the Omega 	Nu Lamba honor society, I am confident that I will continue to be a 4.0 student.</p>
    </div>
	<p>My childhood was filled with travel, homeschooling, and love. My Father is an electrical engineer, and my mother is a stay-at-home mom. Together, my sisters and I were able to be homeschooled K-12. <span class="sentence">Our family has traveled all over the country, taking in such sights as the liberty bell, the grand canyon, and the Statue of Liberty.</span></p>
	<p>With my free time so limited, what small amount I have is dedicated to God, then my family, then myself. I wake up an hour early before work to read several chapters of my Bible to prepare me for the day. If I have time available, I check with my family to see if there are things I need to do.</p>
	<p>I was born in, and grew up around, Huntsville, Alabama. This city is the home of the Space and Rocket Center, as well as Redstone Arsenal. As more companies are formed or move here, the populous continues to increase at an alarming rate.</p>
